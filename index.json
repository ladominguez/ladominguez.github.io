Although the reason is not well understood, it has been reported that these earthquakes give rise to a large number of aftershocks. Our study of the aftershock sequence of the 2012 Mw7.4 Ometepec thrust earthquake suggests that it is most likely due to two dominant factors (1) the presence of an anomalously high quantity of overpressured fluids near the plate interface and (2) the roughness of the plate interface. More than 5400 aftershocks were manually detected during the first 10 d following the 2012 earthquake. Locations were obtained for 2419 events (with duration magnitudes Md¬†‚â•¬†1.5). This is clearly an unusually high number of aftershocks for an earthquake of this magnitude. Furthermore, we generated a more complete catalogue, using an unsupervised fingerprint technique, to detect more smaller events (15‚Äâ593 within 1 month following the main shock). For this catalogue, a high b-value of 1.50¬†¬± 0.10 suggests the presence of fluid release during the aftershock sequence. A low p-value (0.37¬†¬± 0.12) of the Omori law reveals a slow decaying aftershock sequence. The temporal distribution of aftershocks shows peaks of activity with two dominant periods of 12¬†and 24 hr¬†that correlate with the Earth tides. To explain these observations, we suggest that the 2012 aftershock sequence is associated with the presence of overpressured fluids and/or a heterogeneous and irregular plate interface related to the subduction of the neighbouring seamounts. High fluid content has independently been inferred by magnetotelluric surveys and deduced from heat-flow measurements in the region. The presence of fluids in the region has also been proposed to explain the occurrence of slow-slip events, low-frequency earthquakes and tectonic tremors.\"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The influence of fluids in the unusually high-rate seismicity in the Ometepec segment of the Mexican subduction zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Antonio Dom√≠nguez","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In this study, we utilize a template matching approach to detect possible missing earthquakes within a 2-month period before the mainshock. The seismicity rate shows an abrupt increase in the last day around the mainshock hypocenter. The large distance between most of the foreshocks and the mainshock is not consistent with static stress triggering but suggests alternative mechanisms such as delayed dynamic triggering or aseismic transients. Back-projection using the USArray network reveals that the rupture propagated northwestward unilaterally at a speed of 3.6 km/s and terminated north of the Tehuantepec Ridge. Towards the end of the rupture, a wide step-over occurred onto an adjacent fault parallel to the main fault plane. The mainshock is likely a reactivation of subducted outer-rise faults, supported by the similarity of fault-strike angles. The surprisingly large magnitude is consistent with exceedingly large dimensions of outer-rise faulting in this segment of the central Mexican trench.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Nucleation and Kinematic Rupture of the 2017 Mw 8.2 Tehuantepec Earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Antonio Dom√≠nguez"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.

As different transient phenomena continuously load and unload stresses around asperities in an area where megathrust earthquakes nucleate, repeating earthquakes act as track markers for slip on the plate interface. We systematically examined 14‚Äâyears of waveform records from 2001 through 2014 to identify repeating earthquakes along the subducting segment of the Cocos plate. An analysis of waveform similarity resulted in a significant number (224) of earthquake sequences with highly correlated waveforms (correlation coefficient cc‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.95 and spectral coherency coh‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.95). The reported set of correlated waveforms shows a well-defined clustering in space and substantial temporal variability. We find a significant increase of repeating earthquake activity after the 20 March 2012 Ometepec (Mw 7.4) and 18 April 2014 Tecpan (Mw 7.2) earthquakes as a result of the postseismic relaxation. In contrast, the rupture zone of the 1985 (Mw 8.1) Michoac√°n earthquake is completely devoid of repeating sequences, suggesting a strongly coupled segment. Examining the temporal behavior of repeating earthquake activity provides a new tool to better understand how creeping of the subduction thrust controls stress release and postseismic relaxation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Spatiotemporal variations of characteristic repeating earthquake sequences along the Middle America Trench in Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The direct waves are expected to be spatially coherent whereas the scattered waves, arriving with random phase, will be spatially incoherent. Our objective is to use data from an extreme high-resolution seismic experiment in Long Beach, California, to determine the tran- sition from coherent to incoherent coda. The network, deployed by Nodal Seismic, comprises ‚àº5400 vertical compo- nent instruments, spaced every ‚àº100 m over an area of ‚àº5 √ó 7 km2. It was deployed for a period of six months with the primarily target to image the geological structure of the area for oil exploration. During the deployment, several thousand earthquakes and microearthquakes were recorded. We examine coda waves from the two largest events that occurred in the vicinity of the array. We compute frequency‚Äìwavenumber dia- grams to determine the sources of coda and their evolution in time. Entropy analysis of the propagation of seismic waves through the array indicates the transition between the coherent direct body waves and the onset of incoherent coda waves. Our analysis illustrates that after the arrival of the body waves, the seismic coda is initially dominated by a dispersing wave train composed of spatially coherent body waves, forward scattered from 1D crustal layering. This is then followed by omni-direc- tional, spatially incoherent coda waves that can be described as scattered waves from 3D random sources.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Application of fk Analysis and Entropy to Track the Transition from Spatially Coherent to Incoherent Earthquake Coda in Long Beach, California.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Antonio Dom√≠nguez","Davis, Paul"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Our analysis focuses on reconciling laboratory experiments, which suggest that in this frequency range, intrinsic attenuation has a weak to zero frequency dependence, with results obtained using the Multiple Lapse Time Widow (MLTW) method. The MLTW method is designed to separate the contributions of scattering by heterogeneities and intrinsic attenuation from total attenuation assuming spherical geometrical spreading and isotropic scattering. Application of the MLTW method suggests that total attenuation in the MA region is concentrated towards the upper crust and is relatively constant throughout the region. It also shows a strong frequency dependence of the energy loss component of the attenuation (apparent intrinsic attenuation). We test the effect that forward and back scattering operators, distribution of the sources, and absorption of energy into the mantle has on the separation of the components of attenuation. We conclude that the inclusion of the frequency-dependent leakage of energy towards the mantle provides a mechanism to satisfy both laboratory experiments and estimates based on the MLTW method. For the Middle America region, we find that the intrinsic attenuation Q_int=1/2000.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Seismic attenuation in the Middle America Region and the frequency dependence of intrinsic Q","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Antonio Dom√≠nguez","S√°nchez-Sesma, Francisco","Davis, Paul"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

In this study, we analyze seismic records from a portable array perpendicular to the trench that show a distinctive phase with a phase velocity of 3.5km/s following body-wave phases. This signal is better observed following phases with high incident angles such as PS, SP, and SS arriving from the ocean side of the trench and for events at teleseismic distances with magnitudes larger than Mw 7.0, although weak scattered signals were detected for events down to Mw 6.2 and for direct P and S phases. We found that the lateral transition between the dipping slab and continental crust, with an inclined boundary formed by the subducting slab at the trench, generates a strong discontinuity that scatters seismic waves, generating a secondary field with amplitude comparable to the incident wave. This phase appears for incident body-wave arrivals with characteristic wavelength comparable to the thickness of the continental crust. Analysis of the observed scattered field shows that the trapped waves are vertically polarized surface waves. Numerical modeling suggests that the impedance contrast at the trench and the geometry of the subducting slab form a waveguide-like structure that efficiently generates and transmits trapped seismic waves along the continental margin.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Scattering of teleseismic body waves by the lateral crustal heterogeneity at the Pacific trench of Mexico","type":"publication"}]
